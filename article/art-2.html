                <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-weight: normal;">The fabric of space-time is a conceptual model combining the three dimensions of space with the fourth dimension of time.
                    The famous physicist Albert Einstein helped develop the idea of space-time as part of his theory of relativity. Prior to his pioneering work, scientists had two separate theories to explain physical phenomena: Isaac Newton's laws of physics described the motion of massive objects, 
                    while James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic models explained the properties of light, according to NASA.</p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-weight: normal;">A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is 
                        so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.
                        Stellar black holes are made when the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, or collapses. When this happens, it causes a supernova.
                         A supernova is an exploding star that blasts part of the star into space.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p style="text-indent: 50px; font-weight: normal;">Light travels through the fabrics of spacetime.
                        Once a particle of light (‘photon’) passes the ‘event horizon’ of a black hole, it can no longer escape, but there’s nothing to suggest that it is destroyed.

                        Like matter, the photon is rapidly sucked towards the ‘singularity’ at the centre of the black hole, where a huge mass is packed into an infinitely small space. 
                        What happens to photons at these extreme conditions, however, is one of physics’ big unanswered questions.</p>
